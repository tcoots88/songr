# Songr App
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Building Full-Stack Web Apps
## Problem Domain
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
[x]Create a hello world route at /hello, and ensure that you can visit that route in your browser and see a rendered template come back.
<br>
[x]Create a route that turns words into UPPER CASE. For instance, I should be able to visit /capitalize/hello and get back an HTML page containing the response HELLO, or I could visit /capitalize/this is Kinda Capitalized and get an HTML page containing the response THIS IS KINDA CAPITALIZED.
<br>
[x]Create a basic splash page for the Songr app, available at the root route, and style it appropriately with CSS.
<br>
[x]Create an Album class to act as a model in our app.
<br>
[?] Create a route at /albums that shows three album instances. (These will be hardcoded for todayâ€™s lab; create an array that contains three albums, and then display those three on the page.)
### Routes
- localhost.com/8080/capitalize/{textInput}
- localhost.com/8080/hello
- localhost.com/8080/
- localhost.com/8080/albums
- localhost.com/8080/newAlbum
